## Overview

This research compendium helps you identify which hiking trails you can reach with the bus!



## Features

The main purpose of this compendium is to point you to hiking trails that you can reach with the bus (obviously).



## Content

This repository is structured as follow:

- [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/soumaya-belghali/BusRando/tree/main/DESCRIPTION):
contains project metadata (authors, date, dependencies, etc.)

- [`make.R`](https://github.com/soumaya-belghali/BusRando/tree/main/make.R):

contains R functions that return figures and tables

- [`data/`](https://github.com/soumaya-belghali/BusRando/tree/main/data):
just sets the architecture of the folders where the data will be downloaded
by the first step of the workflow (empty for this online repository to save the environment)

- [`outputs/`](https://github.com/soumaya-belghali/BusRando/tree/main/outputs):
contains data for the targets pipeline
